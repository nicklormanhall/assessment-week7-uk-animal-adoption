Week 7 Project: Build a Database Driven Full Stack React & Express App

User Stories

üêøÔ∏è As a user, I want to be able to create new posts and add them to the page
üêøÔ∏è As a user, I want to be able to assign a category to each post
üêøÔ∏è As a user, I want to be able to view all posts added on the page and the category they're in
üêøÔ∏è As a user, I want to be able to view all posts in a specific category by visiting a dedicated page for that category (Stretch Goal)
üêøÔ∏è As a user, I want to be able to add new categories (Stretch Goal)

Requirements

üéØ Design a database schema with relationships between tables

    DONE

üéØ Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
(again, remember the client and the server should be separate)

    DONE

üéØ Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)

    DONE - I created two SQL seed querys in the end the first used junctions: See below. unfortunately I couldn't get the insert to work with the junction tables, so I needed to add the animal type back into the animals table to get the query working.

üéØ Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application.

    DONE

üéØ Create multiple pages using react-router-dom

    DONE

üéØ Create a home page.

    DONE

üéØ Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data.

    DONE

üéØ Create a page where users can create new posts using a form.

    DONE

Was another challenging week. Being out on Thursday I was playing catch up. There was a lot I would have liked to have changed or updated on reflection.

I would have used a junction table query for the animal greeting e.g woof-woof if the animal is a dog, meow if a cat rather than using an if but I didn't have time.

There were several things I was pleased with including, the grid layout, the use of components and Routes.
